ðŸŒ± Osmo is an rudimentary open-source and automated plant careÂ system. We wanted to create a technology that can be efficient and economic in plant care. Also and more importantly we wanted to create something that can enable folks to have agency over their data and then be able to reflect on the performance of their  data. Osmo is a project for all. We hope that farmers, gardeners, tinkerers, house-plant parents, dev's and DIYers  can continually append and evolve this project. Osmo, open-sourced by nature has the ability to be scaled both vertically and horizontally. Leaving room for continual integration and improvement in the future. ðŸŒ± 

Throughout the development of Osmo we kept three pillars in mind. Those three pillars are Sustainability, Accesability, and Concentration of power. These three pillars host issues that are ever so present in the post-industrial U.S food System. We hope to address and help solve those issues with technology like Osmo

For starters, Osmo is low cost modular system. They are a raspberry pi enabled product with sensors that check the soil moisture every second. If the soil is below the ideal moisture threshold, the pump hydrates the soil until the moisture reading is back at the ideal moisture threshold. The soil moisture data, and pump status is then sent to the front-end and presented with a live stream of your plant. The data and livestream can then be accessed on the internet from laptop or other personal device!
