ðŸŒ± Osmo is an modular open-source and automated plant careÂ system. We wanted to create a product that streamlines the plant care process. More importantly, we wanted to create something that can enable folks to have agency over their data and then be able to reflect on the performance of their data and hopefully keep their plants alive while doing so. Osmo is a project for all. We hope that farmers, gardeners, tinkerers, house-plant parents, dev's and DIYers can continually evolve this project. Osmo is modular, it has the ability to be scaled both vertically and horizontally. With the users needs being the fore-front of scale. ðŸŒ± 

Throughout the development of Osmo we kept three pillars in mind. Those three pillars are Sustainability, Accesability, and Concentration of power. These three pillars host issues that are ever so present in the post-industrial U.S food System. With climate change affecting growing seasons, soils and water supplies a sustainable data-based solution is neccessary to mitigate these threats. Overall, we wanted to create a technology that can enable folks to have agency over their data, efficiently water plants, and be accessible to all.

So what is Osmo? For starters, Osmo is low cost modular system. They are a raspberry pi enabled product with sensors that check the soil moisture every second. If the soil is below the ideal moisture threshold, the pump hydrates the soil until the moisture reading is back at the ideal moisture threshold. The soil moisture data, and pump status is then sent to the front-end and presented with a live stream of your plant. The data and livestream can then be accessed on the internet from laptop or other personal device!
